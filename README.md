# Online and Offline Translator
## Overview
This application utilises two libraries from Pypi in order to deliver results, no matter if the user is connected to the internet or not.
- The application asks the user which method they would like to use (online or offline).
- When the user selects a method, a window pops up and prompts the user to select a text file for translation.
- The file is then translated in the terminal.
- The application asks the user whether they want to save the file. If yes, a new window pops up prompted the user to select a directory.
- Finally, the application saves the translation in a text file in the given directory, and prints the directory in the terminal.
